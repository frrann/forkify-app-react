# Overview

This React project is a personal learning exercise designed to closely mimic an existing application, [Forkify application](https://forkify-v2.netlify.app/), created by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann) built with vanilla JavaScript. It serves as a hands-on exploration of React's capabilities, allowing me to gain practical experience in building a similar user interface and functionality.
